<p><i>Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become
    a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a club"). Unlike many other
    football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable sports team in the world, worth
    $5.51 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €582.1 million.</i>
    The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.
    [4] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.</p><br><hr>
